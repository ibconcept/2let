# 2let - Rental Listing and Search App

2let is a mobile application that facilitates the process of posting and searching for rentals. It aims to provide a seamless experience for both tenants and landlords in finding the right rental property that suits their needs and preferences.

## Features

- **Rental Listings**: Tenants can post details of available rentals, including social amenities, water availability, toilet conditions, cleanliness, and other relevant information.
- **Vetting Owners**: The app ensures that landlords are legitimate, and their rental properties are well-maintained. Caretakers assist in verifying the authenticity of the property owners.
- **Tenant Budget and Preferences**: Tenants can specify their budget and preferred location to find suitable rental options.
- **Ranking System**: Both tenants and landlords are ranked based on their history, reliability, and interactions within the app.
- **Fraud Detection**: The app maintains a blacklist of known fraudsters to protect users from potential scams.
- **Payment Flexibility**: Customers only pay the rent after moving into the rental property. There are no goodwill payments or down payments required.
- **Dispute Resolution**: The app includes a crowd-sourced dispute resolution system, where users can resolve issues collectively. Experts can intervene when necessary.
- **Location Insights**: Rental listings display photos of the property's exterior, distance from bus stops and town, and a "Traffic Index" to help tenants assess the location's convenience.
- **Occupancy Status**: Tenants can indicate their plans, such as moving out, exploring options, or currently occupying a property.
